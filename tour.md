    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Simple</h2>
    <p class="lead">In current collaborative software development, the team and designers meet and, since many are visual learners, draw out the plan on a white board.  Be it pen to board or colored sticky notes the team develops almost a sort of visual flow chart for the intended outcome of their design.  Then it is off to the grindstone where they code out the idea.</p>
	
<p class="lead">Finally they team regroups to reevaluate the process.  While this is a great and affective tool to keep people focused and on track, why not remove a few steps?  With the Vision platform not only can you have this same type of collaboration, but as you build out your storyboard, you are building the program and seeing it run instantly</p>

    <p class="lead">No more will you have to code, verify syntax, compile debug, document, wash, rinse and repeat. Using the Vision platform anyone can simply take the pieces of their program and put it together. Not only can you watch your work run live, but without all the added steps involved in coding, the time and monetary saving will enable you to focus on the creativity of the program not this idiosyncrasies.</p>
