    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Design and Develop </h2>
    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Within <i>VISION</i></h2>
    <p class="lead">In current approaches to software development, a team storyboards a software solution using design tools. Then, it is off to a different set of tools where developers code out the idea. Finally, they team regroups to see the efforts of the developers.</p>
	  <p class="lead">While this is a great and effective tool to keep people focused and on track, why not remove a few steps?  With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, not only can you have this same type of collaboration, but as you build out your storyboard, you are building the software solution and seeing it run instantly: all within the same tool.</p>

    <p class="lead"><b><i>VISION</i></b> means you no longer have to code, verify syntax, compile debug, document, wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
    <p class="lead">Every step of the development process in <b><i>VISION</i></b> uses the same approach: connect parts and templates together to design and implement your software solutions.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Re-inventing the Wheel</h2>
    <p class="lead">As you build out your software solutions in <b><i>VISION</i></b>, it only gets easier. The parts of your software that you have created can be turned into templates which can be used over and over again. There is no longer a need to re-invent the same things over and over again!</p>
    <p class="lead">With <b><i>VISION</i></b>, we have written an awesome framework which allows you to focus on your solutions and not our development platform.</p>

Build whatever you want be it a game or a B2B tool heck if you want even your own OS. The program is only limited by your imagination and creativity.</p>
