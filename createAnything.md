    <h2 class="featurette-heading muted">Re-inventing the Wheel</h2>
    <p class="lead">Without the added hassle of current software development processes Vision allows you to focus on what you do best, create.  No more rules, insanely repetitious steps and hoops to jump through, no more constantly checking and rechecking your work, and finally, no more second-guessing yourself.  Now you just build.  Build whatever you want be it a game or a B2B tool heck if you want even your own OS. The program is only limited by your imagination and creativity.</p>

	<p class="lead">As you build it only gets easier because the elements that you have created can be used over and over again so more typing and re-typing heck, no more typing ridiculous amounts! With Vision we “decode software development” we have written the code so you don’t have to all you have left to focus on is your imagination.</p>
